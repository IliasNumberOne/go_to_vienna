    text: "Modeled on St. Peter's in Rome, Peterskirche – the Collegial and Parish Church of St. Peter – is built on a site originally occupied by a Roman church and later by one founded by Charlemagne in 792 AD. The present edifice was built in the 18th century and boasts a massive dome with a superb fresco and many artistic treasures. Other highlights include the Barbara Chapel with its magnificent portal, and in which Franz Karl Remp's Decollation of St. Barbara is found, and the choir with its High Altar and painting of the Immaculate Conception. The church is also noted for its frequent organ recitals. Also of note is the nearby Plague Pillar, a 21-meter-tall Baroque pillar built to commemorate the end of the devastating plague of 1679 that cost at least 75,000 Viennese their lives. The nearby Abbey of the Scots (Schottenstift), built in the 12th century and extensively renovated and enlarged since, is also worth popping into. Its school included Johann Strauss and Austria's last emperor, Charles I, among its pupils, while its fine collection of artwork includes pieces from the 16th to 19th centuries. Address: Petersplatz 1, 1010 Vienna, Austria",
